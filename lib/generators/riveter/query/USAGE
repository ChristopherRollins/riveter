Description:
  Stubs out a new query. Pass the model name, either CamelCased or
  under_scored as the model to base the query on.
  "Query" will be appended to the name of the query class.

  This generator invokes your configured test framework which defaults to TestUnit

  If you pass a namespaced model name (e.g. admin/account or Admin::Account)
  then the generator will create a module (e.g. admin_account)

Examples:
  `rails generate riveter:query portfolio`

    Creates a query class based off of the Portfolio model

      Query: app/queries/portfolio_query.rb

  `rails generate riveter:query admin/account`

    Creates a query class based off of the Admin::Account model

      Query: app/queries/admin/account_query.rb
